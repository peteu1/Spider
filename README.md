# Spider
Android app: Spider Solitaire using a single card deck

Set-up:
- From AndroidStudio, open the outer-most directory (Spider) as the project.
- Allow AndroidStudio to configure all the gradle stuff, then restart the program.

Considerations:
- Not sure if we should add all the gradle stuff to the gitignore, and let our own machines configure it on its own. This part I don't know anything about. But I got it set-up finally on new machine (with having to let it change those gradle/manifest/settings files) and fixed the app and can run/play it on my android.
